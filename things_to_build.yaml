# Handy substitutions:
# --------------
# %{PROJECT_DIR}  = the project directory (containing the spec file)
# %{DOWNLOAD_DIR} = the directory that Source0 is downloaded into before tarring (dist/<name>-<version>/)
# %{SOURCES_DIR}  = directory to stage "extra" source files/archive beyond Source0
# %{VERSION}      = the value of :version
#
# Notes:
#   :version
#      Used to name the tarball and as the git tag
#
# TODO: Use :sources array for downloads instead of assuming DOWLOAD_DIR for Source0 and SOURCES_DIR for others

# TPM2.0 simulator
# ----------------
#
# * The tpm2-tools group specifically recommend AGAINST risking a hardware TPM
#   for development, testing, or learningâ€•instead, they recommend using the
#   TCG's reference TPM 2.0 simulator.
# * IBM maintains a project that modifies the TCG's simulator source code
#   (embedded in the TPM 2.0 specification docs) to build under Linux.
# * The tpm2-tools project uses the IBM simulator to test their code.
#
# Build 974:
#   * Is what tpm2-tools 3.0.* is tested against
#   * TPM specification draft revision 142, with errata to revision 138.
#
# Build 1119 supports:
#   * Nuvoton TPM vendor-specific commands
#   * Support for OpenSSL 1.1.x
#   * The TPM starts powered up, so the initial power up command is not necessary.
#   * An update to TPM specification draft revision 146, which is avalable for
#     public review, including changes to TPM2_CreateLoaded and
#     TPM2_EncryptDecrypt.
#
# Build 1332 Includes:
#   * SIMULATON is disabled by default, so each new NVChip yields new random seeds
#   * SHA-512 is supported
#   * Supports 7 evict objects to agree with PC Client standard
#   * Added support for IPv6, but it has not been tested. Please report success or bugs.
#   * Updated with TPM specification rev 149 bug fixes.
#   * fflush() added after fwrite() everywhere to ensure NV is weritten before a Ctrl-C#
